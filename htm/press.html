				<p id="paragraph4">Monsieur Benjamin feels honest and wonderful, a place that seems destined to have a long run.<br>
					–3 Stars, Michael Bauer, San Francisco Chronicle<br><br>

					Corey Lee, formerly of Forbes Travel Guide Five-Star The French Laundry, has been stunning critics 
					and diners…we are eagerly anticipating his second act: Monsieur Benjamin.<br>
					– Forbes Travel Guide<br><br>

					Monsieur Benjamin will be offering something that we don’t have a lot of in this town: traditional
					French bistro dishes with seasonal ingredients, and updated with some modern techniques. <br>
					– Tablehopper<br><br>

					Monsieur Benjamin will stay open till 1 a.m., serving the kind of food that a chef rigorously trained
					in the French system, like Lee, might cook for friends on his night off.<br>
					– Food & Wine<br><br>

					…an exciting new restaurant bubbling with energy and the promise of impeccable French bistro fare and 
					killer cocktails until the wee hours—every night of the week.<br>
					– 7×7<br><br>

					Stellar food, beautiful space, impecable service. What else could you ask for? We loved the menu so 
					much we wouldn't let the waiter take it, because we knew there would be other items we might want to try<br>
					-Tracy P<br><br>

					We dined here before a Symphony concert and had high expectations based on reviews on this site.
					However, our experience was mixed. The service was very good but the atmosphere was average. The 
					food turned out to be a mixed bag. The appetizers and desserts were tasty but the entrees.... not 
					so much. The presentation was lacking and the tastes were bland. We left disappointed and will go
					elsewhere in the future for a better dining experience.<br>
					-Daveand Judy<br><br>

					Chic, cosmopolitan, easy and comforting. Not a likely combination but so wonderful. Elegant and 
					refined service without a hint of ostentation. The cuisine is classic with that quintessential California flair. 
					A perfect Sunday brunch.<br>
					-MPNC1123<br><br>

					The restaurant is in a great location. And, the space is pretty cool because the building is new.
					(Though, I prefer not to have coed bathrooms.) The food was also quite good and the prices are reasonable. Good option for brunch.<br>
					-dna7575<br><br>

					We were off to the symphony and were looking for something good and close enough. We were quite 
					happy with our experience. A newish French bistro, lovely ambience and a charming proprietor, M 
					Tomas, who greeted everyone. Nice choice of wines. I had a good cote de rhone. Wife had moules. 
					Fresh and good sauce. Pomme frites were pretty good, but have had better. I had roasted chicken. 
					Liked the sauce and skin was nice and crispy. Best was dessert. Gateaux with hazelnut and chocolate.
					Price was reasonable compared to other places in the area. Will return when in the area.<br>
					-Dennis B<br><br>

					three people visited and shared food as source of this review. one person had eaten here multiple 
					times. this is a restaurant with modern architecture, bar in the middle, well-lit, although open, 
					not bad for conversation. no hassle over the time at the table on a Monday night. I have only one 
					quibble, which is that bread was not automatically served. one guest had a really delicious mixed 
					drink. one had steak frites, served exactly as ordered with nice helping of straw french fries. 
					side of brussels sprouts totally tasty. i had arctic char, well presented.<br>
