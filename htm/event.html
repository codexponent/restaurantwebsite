				<h2>The Shower Room</h2><br/>
				<h3>Max Capacity: 20 People</h3><br/>
				<p class="paragraph3">Elegance is the operative term to describe the Shower Room. With a large communal
				table capable of seating 14, this room can be supplemented with an additional table to accommodate up to
				20. Your guests can relax in a separate seating area and a window overlooking our main dining room
				connects you to the energy that makes The Grey a unique venue in Savannah.</p><br><br>
				<h2>The Boiler Room</h2><br/>
				<h3>Max Capacity: 10 People</h3><br/>
				<p class="paragraph3">An intimate setting for up to 10 people, The Boiler Room is the perfect place to
				host a small gathering for business, friends or family. Just off of our wine room, this is the most 
				private space in The Grey. With its exposed brick, elegant lighting and old world charm, you and your 
				guests will feel warm and welcome. And, there is a piano and a guitar at your disposal… just in case.</p><br><br>
				<h2>The Diner Bar</h2><br/>
				<h3>Max Capacity: 20 People</h3><br/>
				<p class="paragraph3">With its Hopper-esque picture window overlooking MLK, the Diner Bar is transportive 
				in its appearance, personality and focus on craft cocktails. With the ability to host up to 45 people,
				this is an ideal gathering spot for a casual business event or drinks and snacks with family and friends
				in a comfortable environment. We are happy to host all types of events in the Diner Bar including happy
				hours, meet ups and wedding-related parties.</p><br><br>
				<h2>The Yard</h2><br/>
				<h3>Max Capacity: 40 People</h3><br/>
				<p class="paragraph3">The sky is the limit in The Yard. With communal seating for up to 150, we can also
				customize your experience through our relationships with our vendors to provide as much seating as you need,
				tents, outdoor cooling and entertainment. The Yard is a party waiting to happen.</p><br><br>
